# Jeopardy Rush - a speed trivia game

Live Url: www.jeopardyrush.com

## Overview

This is a trivia game based on Jeopardy! questions (answers) that I got from j-archive. It's built on React in a mobile-first workflow.

## Updates

This is already the second iteration of the website. The first was from when I first started developing, written in vanilla JS, and it was generally a mess. I'm hoping to add user authentication and statistics/dashboard features in the near future.
